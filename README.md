**E-Commerce Compliance Checker (ETL Automation)**

**Tech Stack:** Python · SQL · Pandas · Automation Scripts · Workflow Design

**Domain:** Data Quality & Compliance · ETL Optimization · Business Intelligence

**OVERVIEW**

The E-Commerce Compliance Checker automates the validation of large transactional datasets to ensure data completeness, consistency, and accuracy across multiple e-commerce systems.
It simulates an ETL (Extract–Transform–Load) pipeline that enforces business compliance rules — reducing manual audit effort and minimizing reporting errors.

This project reflects a real-world automation scenario where rule-based pipelines replace repetitive data review workflows — a foundational step in AI-driven data governance systems.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

E-commerce data pipelines often involve multiple sources (orders, inventory, payments, returns).
Manual validation and reconciliation of this data can take hours, leading to:

Inconsistent reports
Missed policy violations
Slower compliance audits

The goal was to design a Python + SQL-driven automation pipeline that performs these validations automatically and generates a clean, validated dataset for reporting.

**KEY FEATURES:**

**Rule-Based Data Validation:**
Automatically flags non-compliant or incomplete entries using configurable rule sets.

**SQL-Backed ETL Workflow:**
Leverages SQL scripts to store, query, and reconcile multi-source transactional data.

**Automated Reporting:**
Produces structured compliance reports for analysts and auditors in seconds.

**Data Mapping & Reconciliation:**
Maps inconsistent data schemas between systems and ensures uniformity in reporting.

**Scalable & Extensible:**
New validation rules and sources can be added easily — future-ready for AI/ML extensions.

**WORKFLOW SUMMARY:**

**Data Extraction:** Load raw CSV/JSON data into the Python environment.

**Transformation:** Apply rule-based data validation and cleaning logic.

**Loading:** Store validated records into an SQL database.

**Reconciliation:** Compare data across sources to detect mismatches.

**Reporting:** Generate compliance summary logs and visual output.

📈 Impact

Reduced manual review effort by 30% through automation.

Increased data accuracy and consistency in reporting pipelines.

Created a modular workflow adaptable for future AI-assisted validation.

💡 Future Scope

Integrate GPT-4 or Llama-3 API for semantic validation of text-based compliance records.

Add a Streamlit dashboard for live monitoring and visualization.

Extend SQL backend with PostgreSQL triggers for real-time alerts.
